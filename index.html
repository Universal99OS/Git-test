            <span id="red">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown, fuzzy, and found in the
                produce
                section</span> of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native
            to eastern
            Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in
            New Zealand.

    <h2 class="topic">HABITAT AND DIET</h2>
    <p class="paramodifier">The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep and wet,
        surrounded by
        shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or escape
        from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat. The
        bird digs multiple burrows within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest burrows, dug early in the
        season, become overgrown at the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay her
        eggs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="topic">FAMILY LIFE</h2>

    <p class="paramodifier">Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr
        during mating. Pairs do fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for his
        company. If another kiwi invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight
        to the death, although this is rare.
    </p>

    <p class="paramodifier">An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a more desirable
        one wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows
        one around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, the female might wander off or try to scare him
        away.Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug by
        the male.
    </p>

    <p class="paramodifier" id="parathree">The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in
        color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that
        would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared
        to the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14
        kilograms) rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).
